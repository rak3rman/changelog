# Changelog: New!

## Purpose

To me, a changelog is an underrated way to showcase to others what you're building and why it matters.
When used well, it shows that you are fast, organized, and exceptional.

A tool like this typically surrounds a company or a single product, used to communicate progress to customers and stakeholders.
But I see potential in using one personally: a way to reflect, document momentum, and build in public.

## Practicality

Changelog v0 was built on three tools: Lit, Next, and MDX.
Lit was chosen for its framework-agnostic flexibility, allowing this template to adapt across future projects and frontends.
Next provides a stable, industry-standard foundation.
MDX powers the document-driven update flow, making changelog entries simple to write and publish.

Future versions will focus on email updates, extensibility, developer experience, and a changelog peer-to-peer subscriptions concept — my spin on RSS feeds.
It might sound strange, but I see value in “subscribing” my personal changelog to the products I'm building alongside it.
More on that soon.

The UI borrows design concepts from [Linear’s Changelog](https://linear.app/changelog), [Cursor's Changelog](https://www.cursor.com/changelog) and [Mark 4 (radison.io)](https://radison.io).
