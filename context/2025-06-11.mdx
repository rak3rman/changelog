# Mark 4: Progressively faster

## Performance overhaul

[Mark 4 (radison.io)](https://radison.io) is now faster than ever.
The underlying architecture has been rebuilt as a Progressive Web App (PWA),
bringing near-instant navigation, seamless reloads, and offline support across the entire site.
Every interaction is radically fluid.

## Link thumbnails

Sharing links from radison.io now generates rich, mark-4-themed thumbnails.
Each page renders its own [Open Graph (OG)](https://ogp.me) preview image on the fly using [nuxt-og-image](https://nuxt.com/modules/og-image).
