# Virtual Tags

Virtual tags allow you to dynamically categorize items and outfits in Shafa without needing to manually assign labels. These tags are auto-generated based on item metadata, usage patterns, and contextual cues, making it easier to search, filter, and gain insights.

## Smarter organization

Virtual tags like #idea, #frequently-worn, or #low-rotation help surface meaningful patterns in your wardrobe. These tags evolve as your data grows and reflect the current state of your style, enabling a more adaptive and intelligent experience.

## Better outfit suggestions

Tags are now leveraged by the outfit suggestion engine to help prioritize items in or out of rotation. Whether you’re looking to cycle in underutilized pieces or revisit past favorites, Shafa helps you strike the right balance with just a tap.
