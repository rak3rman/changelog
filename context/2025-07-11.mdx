# Tam Week

![Mt. Tam](https://imagedelivery.net/5zM6Rdl2uV8Hmr9WxRh20g/8c899a9a-e960-4d70-233d-c71b0127cf00/lg)

From July 7–11, I participated in [Tam Week](https://www.ornotbike.com/pages/tamweek): a 5-day cycling challenge hosted by [Ornot](https://www.ornotbike.com) that invites riders to summit Mt. Tamalpais as many times as they can. I committed to doing it the hard way: biking from downtown San Francisco, through Sausalito and Mill Valley, to the top of West Peak — and back — every day.

In the end, I totalled over **270 miles, 15,500 ft of elevation gain, and 22 hours in the saddle.** I also passed 2,500 lifetime miles on my gravel bike along the way.

Tam Week was a humbling test of my fitness and mental headspace. It was tough. For finishing all 5 days, I picked up an Ornot Park Jersey, socks, poster, and a well-deserved donut.

I guess you'll catch me pushing code... and pedals.
