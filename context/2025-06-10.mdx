# Steven Olikara: Personal polish

![Steven Olikara's Website Screenshot](https://imagedelivery.net/5zM6Rdl2uV8Hmr9WxRh20g/5351a955-7c13-4a6f-58eb-6f2e816cb500/xl)

Following Steven Olikara's run for U.S. Senate in 2022, Steven and I decided to spin the original campaign website into a intermediary personal portfolio.
The personal site sat dormant for some time, as Steven (and I) focused on defining our next chapters.

Today, we're giving that portfolio a meaningful refresh.
The updated site better reflects Steven's recent media work, creative direction, and public speaking momentum.

There's still plenty left to refine. Over the next couple months, we'll continue to shape the site around Steven's style, purpose, and presence.

Visit the new site at [stevenolikara.com](https://stevenolikara.com).
