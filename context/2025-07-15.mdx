# Caffeine Hackathon

Earlier this week, I participated in the Caffeine Hackathon — a 4 hour sprint to build a working, production-ready app using nothing but natural language. No IDE. No local dev. No boilerplate. Just my overdressed self, a prompt window, and an AI dev environment built on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org).

[Caffeine](https://caffeine.ai) is a full-stack vibe coding platform (kinda). You describe what you want, and the system scaffolds it in real time. Think infrastructure, logic, UI, and data all orchestrated through a conversational interface. It’s a interesting take on app development, where your ability to express intent is the primary skill.

## Flexor: Personalized Mobility Routines

Out of the hackathon came Flexor, an adaptive mobility tool that creates personalized stretch routines based on how your body feels and what you’ve recently done.

In just 4 hours, I built something that would typically take a small team 36+ hours. It features a working LLM-enabled routine generator, body-state inputs, and an activity log.

Out of 80 total projects, Flexor placed in the **top 9 overall** and **top 5** in the technical track.
