# Outfit Builder Additions

The Outfit Builder has been updated to support a faster, more intuitive creation flow. Whether you’re assembling from scratch or remixing a past favorite, building an outfit is now smoother than ever.

## Add items inline

You can now add wardrobe items directly within the Outfit Builder. No more context-switching — simply search, filter, and drop items into your outfit without leaving the builder interface. It’s fast, fluid, and built for daily use.

## Reuse made simple

Quickly access recently worn or top-rated items from a smart suggestions tray. This tray updates based on your usage patterns, making outfit composition feel less like a chore and more like a creative spark.
